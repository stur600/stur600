					<h1>Background</h1>
					<p>The current work discusses some of the methodology of my PhD work, which seeks to combine sociological theory and network analysis to 
					understand gendered and classed patterns in science education in New Zealand. This work was originally presented at the satelite session "People, Places, Things" at 
					the Network Science conference (Netsci2018) in Paris on the 12th of June, 2018. The aim of this write up is to explain, in basic terms, the 
					benefits of using networks to represent large, complex data regarding students' pathways through science, but also how the sociological theory 
					outlined by Pierre Bourdieu can serve as an excellent guide for the research process. Bourdieu's theory provides a great framework for 
					developing initial research questions, whilst it also provides a means of placing research findings in a broad societal context. This wall of text will 
					seek to:<p>
					<p><li>give a quick introduction to the motivations behind this research, specifically the issue of gender equity in science education.</li></p>
					<p><li>offer a quick introduction to how networks can be used to understand students' science course selection, and represent trends in course selction by gender.</li></p>
					<p><li>provide a simple overview of the Pierre Bourdieu's sociological theory, using examples of how it can be applied to science education.</li></p>
					<p><li>demonstrate how networks can be used to represent Bourdieu's theory using preliminary results from research using New Zealand's Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI).</li></p>

					<h1> The Issue at Hand</h1>
					<p>Historically, women and minority groups have been underrepresented in scientific disciplines. Modern day trends tend to show this pattern of
					science engagement operates at a more fine grained level, with subjects such as physics, mathematics, computer science, and engineering tending 
					to be male dominated, while the life science subjects (biology, medicine, health) tend to be more equal in terms of gender representation. 
					This trend is common at all stages of post-compulsory education in New Zealand, and also internationally in Europe (Stevanovic, 2013; Institute of Physics, 2012; Institute of Physics, 2013; Smith, 2011) and the United States (NSF; Cunningham, 2015; Kost-Smith, 2010; Heilbronner, 2012).  </p>

					</center>
					<br>
					<p>With the increasing abundance of data, we can begin to unpack where gender and class disparities occur, and maybe even why they occur. In my 
					case, I will discuss how I am using the Integrated Data Infrasture (IDI) to try and provide an in depth understanding of pathways through science 
					education, and how they may vary at the intersection of gender and social class. The IDI is a collection a datasets hosted by Statistics New 
					Zealand that contains information regarding students' subject selection and performance at all stages of education, tied at an individual level 
					to the census. We therefore have an incredibily rich dataset that we can analyse. However, with this richness, we also have an increased level of complexity that can make it difficult to generate and 
					answer research questions. Luckily, network analysis offers a method of analysis that tackles complex data and offers a way of revealing trends.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>A network is basically a collection of nodes (dots) and edges (lines that connect dots). Nodes can represent anything, such as agents (people), 
					institutions (e.g., universities), and objects. The edges represent instances where two nodes share a relationship of some kind.
					We can assign attributes to the nodes and edges in a network. For example if a node represents a person, it may have information regarding gender,
					ethnicity, or other demographic information. Edge attributes represent the characteristics of the relationship shared between nodes. An important 
					edge attribute is the weight of the edge. This is a value that is used to represent the strength of a relationship between two nodes, and may be derived in 
					a multitude of ways (such as frequency, distance, correlations, amongst others).

					<p>The image presented above provides an example of a network that uses student data. In this network, nodes represent courses offered by the University of 
					Auckland. Edges represent instances where a student took a pair of courses within their first year at the university. Instead of having a single edge 
					for each student who took a pair of courses, we can aggregate these edges and use that frequency as a weight for a single edge. In our case, we have 
					used a different metric called Revealed Comparitive Preference (RCP) to highlight the pairs of courses that are most interesting. This 
					type of weight brings a pair of courses closer together if there more students taking that pair of courses relative to the overall population of the network, and the number of 
				   in each course. </p>
					
					<br>
					<p>Once this network has been formed, we can run community detection to reveal the clusters of courses that tended to be taken together. In our case, 
					we used Louvain community detection, which is an algorithm that groups nodes together by maximising the modularity score of the network. 
					This is a fancy way of saying that nodes that have lots of connections are grouped together, while nodes in different communities have sparcer connections
					Each community seems to represent a different degree structurs at the University of Auckland, which is not surprising. For example, we would expect Bachelor of Arts students
					to take similar courses to one another, and different from Bachelor of Science students. Red seems to represent the arts, yellow science, purple engineering, and orange music. </p>
					
					<p>Now we can look at subsets of the main network in more detail. In the following case, I have just taken the students who studied at least one 
					physics course at the University of Auckland.</p>
					<center>
					<IMG src="PhysNetwork1.png" alt="physicsStudentNetwork" style="width: 100%;">
					</center>
					<br>
					<p><li>We can compare male and female students by aggregating edges within and between communities based on the gender of the student. 
					The following network presents a cleaner version of the network by summarising each community into a single node that is labeled according to the 
					courses that are present within the community. Edges in the network are show an odds ratio: the likelihood of a female student taking a pair of courses 
					within a community (self-loops) or between two communities. The size of the nodes now represent aggregated course populations for each community. </li></p>

					<p>As we can see, female students were around 3.4 times more likely to take a pair of courses within the life sciences and psychology community. 
					Male students were more likely to take courses within the physics, maths, computer science community and between that community and engineering.</li></p>

					<h1> The Leaky Pipeline</h1>
					<p>Now the trends identified in our network analysis, although interesting, are very common for post-compulsory education 
					in New Zealand and across the world. Historically, these patterns have been explained in terms of the "Leaky Pipeline". This model basically 
					presents the idea that science education is like a big long pipe that stretches from primary school all the way through high school, and 
					finally ends with graduation from university and entering into the workforce. However, with each transition from one educational stage
					to the next, students "leak" out of the pipeline and disappear forever. The gender disparities outlined in our networks would therefore 
					be explained in terms of female students being more likely to leak from physics, maths, engineering etc., and male students being more likely 
					to leak from the life sciences. Students can take a wide range of pathways through high school and university study. Instead of one big pipe, we need to start thinking in terms of a complex collection of pipes, each 
					one pretty much unique to individual students. Students don't leak, they make study decisions based on the realities in which they are based. Labelling students as leaks or dropouts stigmatizes the individual and neglects the socio-cultural context in which students are placed. With the 
					increasing abundance of student data we have no excuse for ignoring context.
					</p>
					
					<br><br>
					<br>
					<br>
					
					<center><h1> If we want to understand and address gender and classed disparities in science 
					education, we need to move beyond the leaky pipeline model of student attrition and onto research frameworks 
					that consider the complex nature of society.</h1></center>

				<h1> Pierre Bourdieu</h1>

					</center>
					
					<p><i>Pierre Bourdieu realising he left the oven on at home - photograph by Leonardo Antoniadis </i></p>
					<p>The sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu offers one such avenue for framing the journeys that students 
					take through higher education. Bourdieu was a french sociologist who was active from around 1960 to 1990, with his work (in partiular
					his seminal book "Distinction") leaving a lasting influence on educational research. One major advantage offered by Bourdieu's framework is 
					the manner by which it encourages a mixed method approach to research. For Bourdieu, a true social science is one that combines the objective, 
					and quantitative, with the subjective and qualitative. His original work included ethnographic research, photograph case studies, interviews, 
					and large scale surveys. With so many different approaches, it is difficult to understand how they can fit together to provide a 
					cohesive narritive about how society operates. Bourdieu's theoretical framework provides a means to tackle this issue. His theory not only allows
					us to interpret both quantitative and qualitive results, but it also provides a method of understanding how the objective and subjective are 
					linked (he dubbed this mode of inquiry Genetic Structuralism).</p>
					
					<p>In the simplest terms, Bourdieu was interested in the way that power is distributed in society, and how this relates to an individual's
					practices (behaviours and attitudes) within society. The theoretical framework that he conceptualised is vast, and since this aim of this piece is to 
					offer a quick introduction to his work, I will be focussing on a simplified theoretical model that Bourdieu outlined in Distinction. </p>

					<br>
					<p>Bourdieu saw an individual's practices (behaviours and attitudes) in society as being generated by the interaction between capital and habitus.
					The following sections will define and describe these concepts within the context of science education.

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-9 col-md-offset-0">
					<p><h1>Capital</h1></p>
					<p>Capital is a resource that one can use to gain advantage in society. For Bourdieu, it can take one of four forms: economic, cultural, social 
					or symbolic. For this piece, I will focus on economic and cultural capital, as it is these two forms of capital that are the most relevant in the 
					research I will discuss later. For a fuller explanation of capital, The Forms of Capital by Bourdieu is the best place to start.</li></p>
					<br>
					

					
					<br>


					<center>
						<IMG src="EconomicCapital.png" alt="EconomicCapital" style="width: 100%;">
					</center>
					<br>
					
					Economic capital is simply the financial resources that one can use to gain advantage. It can take the form of money, or be institutionalised 
					in the form of property rights. Economic capital can be easily exchanged for objects that can benefit one's education (i.e., text books, computers).
					It can also be exchanged for tuition and tertiary study. It is probably no surprise that individuals with a high volume of economic capital 
					tend to have better educational outcomes. 
					
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>

					<center>
						<IMG src="CulturalCapital.png" alt="CulturalCapital" style="width: 100%;">
					</center>
					<p>Bourdieu is probably most famous for his concept of cultural capital. It refers to an individual's non-financial assets. This can refer
					to the objects we engage with, such as the textbooks, computers, and media (e.g., tv shows). It is easy to understand how this form of 
					objectified cultural capital can be advantageous for students. If you grow up reading science textbooks or magazines, you will likely do
					better with science at school. But cultural capital also operates at a more tacit level. Over time, our interactions with cultural objects 
					become embodied. Embodiment is a process in which the stuff we interact with in our environment becomes a part of our body. It changes the 
					way we carry ourselves, the way we talk, and the way in which we see our place in the world. For Bourdieu, the objects become an "integral 
					part of our self". A good example of the relationship between objectified cultural capital and embodied cultural capital can be seen when
					if we go the gym. The gym machines, barbells and so on are all examples of cultural objects. If we interact with these objects over an 
					extended period, our body physically changes as our muscles get bigger. Our embodiment of cultural capital changes the way in which people
					see us ("have you been working out?"), and also the way we see ourselves. With regards to science related objects, the more we engage with them,
					the more likely we will associate with science, and see ourselves as a "science person".

					<h2>Habitus</h2>
					The mental component of embodied cultural capital is strongly tied to what Bourdieu called habitus. Habitus is the system of dispositions
					that one uses to interpret the world, and is formed in relationship to the socio-cultural and histoical context in which we are placed. 
					Echoing the manner in which embodied cultural capital is formed over time as we engage with the objects around us, habitus is formed
					over time in relation to society. We constantly internalise our environment and use what we experience to inform how we interpret the world.
					What do people like me do? How are people like me treated in this area? Do I enjoy studying this subject? Habitus is the second concept in 
					the Bourdieu's theortical model and it interacts with capital to generate our practices. So our practices (attitudes and behaviours) are
					generated by the the resources that we can use (capital) and our world view (habitus).

					<h2>How Capital Relates to Equity</h2>
					<p>The key thing for Bourdieu is that inequity is driven by the fact that capital is not distributed evenly across society. By this I mean that 
					some individuals can be born with a high level of resources at their disposal, whilst others can be born into poverty. It may be clear how this 
					relates to economic capital. Being born into wealth is one of the best predictors of educational success (for examples see PISA). But Bourdieu especially emphasized the 
					advantages gain by being born into a family that shares the dominant culture in society. These individuals learn from the very begining the 'correct'
					way of behaving, speaking, and interacting with those in charge. The concept of cultural capital is more tacit than economic capital, but one example that
					has a clear and lasting impact is language. Individuals who are born into families who have a good grasp of the dominant language (i.e., the one used by 
					schools) have a clear advantage when it comes to schooling. They are more likely to enter education with the literacy skills required to function 
					in the classroom. Kids born into families that either do not speak the dominant language or do not have a lifetime of experience with it will start on the 
					back foot.
					<br>
					<br>
					Capital is also accumulative. This means that the more capital you have, you are more able to invest it in ways that return more capital. 
					A good example of this can be seen in education. If your family has lots of money, you can afford to go to university. 
					With a university degree you are more able to get a high paying job, and therefore get more money.</p>

							<img src="BourdieuModelField.png" alt="Bourdieu Theoretical Model" style="width: 100%;">
					</center>
					
					<br>
					<p>Our practices are not generated in a vacuum. As I outlined previously, one of the major strengths of Bourdieu's theory is that it places
					strong emphasis on the socio-cultual and historical context in which a student is placed. For Bourdieu, the context in which a student is 
					placed is called a field. A field is basically any place where an individual acts. Therefore the social world is comprised of many different fields.
					For example within the field of education, we also have the field of science. Within science, we have the fields of social science, physics, 
					chemistry, biology and so on. The key thing is each field has its own rules on what forms of capital are valued, and these are determined 
					by those that have power in the field.</p>
					
					<p> But how do we find out what forms of capital are valued? How do we identify which forms of capital are valued in the field, and what forms 
					of logic operate that constrain or facilitate the success of an individual? One of Bourdieu's main goals was to identify quantitative methods that
					can answer these questions. Bourdieu even developed his own quantitative approach that he believed offered a true model of the structure of the field;
					a form of factor analysis called Multiple Correspondence Analysis.

					<p><h1>Multiple Correspondence Analysis</h1></p>
					Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) is a technique developed by Bourdieu that is used to analysis large, categorical datasets. 
					Much like network analysis, MCA is used to represent data in geometric space. In basic terms, MCA takes an indicator matrix, where rows
					are individuals in the dataset, columns are categorical variables (male, female, subject studies), and values indicate whether the categorical
					variable applies to the individual (1 usually indicates true, 0 false). The goal is to highlight the categories that commonly cooccur 
					often for individuals in the dataset, or conversly, do not cooccur very often. We can do this through eigenvector decomposition, that takes the matrix
					and breaks it down into the dimensions that explain the most variance in the data. In simpler terms, we are left with dimensions that may represent
					some kind of underlying pattern in the categories. The following section provides examples from Bourdieu's work, and my own work, which show an MCA
					map (the visual representation of the MCA) across the first two main underlying dimensions.

					<p>The MCA map presented above shows the structure of the field of taste in French society in the 1980's. 
					The map provides a two dimensional representation of a survey of taste (music, art, food etc.). Bourdieu interpretted 
					this output as showing that French society was structured across the dimensions of economic and cultural capital (the horizontal axis). 
					Individuals who had a high volume of cultural capital, and low economic capital, are located on the left hand side, and vice versa on the 
					right hand side. Items that coccur often are located close to one another in the map (i.e., individuals know few musical works also
					tend to find paintings nice but difficult). Items that are far away are relatively unlikely to cooccur (individuals that know 12+ musical works
					were less likely to like the Blue Danube). The vertical access represents a logic operating on the field, where indivuals are split
					by "seneriority in the bourgiousie". Upper class individuals are located towards the top, working class towards the bottom. So for Bourdieu,
					taste in French society is mainly structured by the distribution of economic and cultural capital, and class.</p>

					<p><h1>MCA of New Zealand Science Education</h1></p>	
					<p>I have repeated the same type of analysis, but instead the field I am interested in is science education in New Zealand (between the years 
					2009-2015). This analysis used data from the IDI, and contains the following variables:</p>
					<p><li>High school profile (did the student study science at high school, and if so, what was their main discipline?</li></p>
					<p><li>Did the student attend a tertiary institution, and if so, what did they study ("Other" encompasses all non-science disciplines)?</li></p>
					<p><li>How well did the student perform at high school across all subject disciplines (binned into quartiles, 1st quatile being the top 25%)? </li></p>
					<p><li>How many of the student's parents went to university (0,1, or 2) </li></p>
					<p><li>Student gender (male or female, non-binary information was not available).</li></p>
					<br>
					<p>
					Whilst this list is not an exaughstive summary of the characteristics that are likely important in determining progression in science, they have
					been selected due to prior research suggesting their importance. Ethnicity is definitely an important characteristic that needs to be considered,
					and I am currently working on the best way to incorporate it into the analysis (in particular, I am assessing the best way to deal with mutliple
					ethnicities). Measures of deprivation and direct measures of economic capital also need to be included in the future.</p>
					<br>
					
					<p>We can see that the horizontal dimension appears to represent cultural capital. Individuals who had parents who went to university are also
					more likely to be top achievers in high school (a measure of institutionalised cultural capital). Individuals who have high cultural capital
					(according to this interpretation) are more likely to go to university, and prehaps more interestingly, study science at high school and university.
					Individuals with relatively lower cultural capital are more likely to go to polytechnic or private institutions, which provide more vocational degrees,
					or not attend a tertiary instituion at all. These individuals are also less likely to study science at high school and tertiary level. The vertical
					dimension seems to represent the gender disparities that are so prevalent in science education. If a student is male, they are more likely to
					study engineering and computer science, regardless of cultural capital. Female students seem relatively more likely to take health and
					social science.</p>
