					<h1>Background</h1>
					<p>The current work discusses some of the methodology of my PhD work, which seeks to combine sociological theory and network analysis to 
					understand gendered and classed patterns in science education in New Zealand. This work was originally presented at the satelite session "People, Places, Things" at 
					the Network Science conference (Netsci2018) in Paris on the 12th of June, 2018. The aim of this write up is to explain, in basic terms, the 
					benefits of using networks to represent large, complex data regarding students' pathways through science, but also how the sociological theory 
					outlined by Pierre Bourdieu can serve as an excellent guide for the research process. In particular, Bourdieu's theory provides a great framework for 
					developing initial research questions, whilst it also provides a means of placing research findings in a broad societal context. This wall of text will 
					seek to:<p>
					<p><li>give a quick introduction to the motivations behind this research, specifically the issue of gender equity in science education.</li></p>
					<p><li>offer an quick introduction to how networks can be used to understand students' science course selection, and represent trends in course selction by gender.</li></p>
					<p><li>provide a simple overview of the Pierre Bourdieu's sociological theory, using examples of how it applied to science education.</li></p>
					<p><li>demonstrate how networks can be used to represent Bourdieu's theory using preliminary results from research using New Zealand's Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI).</li></p>

					<h1> The Issue at Hand</h1>
					<p>Historically, women and minority groups have been underrepresented in scientific disciplines. Modern day trends tend to show this pattern of
					science engagement operates at a more fine grained level, with subjects such as physics, mathematics, computer science, and engineering tending 
					to be male dominated, while the life science subjects (biology, medicine, health) tend to be more equal in terms of gender representation. 
					This trend is common at all stages of post-compulsory education in New Zealand, and also internationally in Europe, the United States,  </p>
					<br>

					<center>
						<IMG src="stereotypes.jpg" alt="stereotypes" style="width: 100%;">
					</center>
					<br>
					<p>With the increasing abundance of data, we can begin to unpack where gender and class disparities occur, and maybe even why they occur. In my 
					case, I will discuss how I am using the Integrated Data Infrasture (IDI) to try and provide an in depth understanding of pathways through science 
					education, and how they may vary at the intersection of gender and social class. The IDI is a collection a datasets hosted by Statistics New 
					Zealand that contains information regarding student's subject selection and performance at all stages of education, tied at an individual level 
					to the census (and also lots of other dataset that I have not explored as of yet). We therefore have an incredibily rich dataset 
					that we can analyse. However, with this richness, we also have an increased level of complexity that can make it difficult to generate and 
					answer research questions. Luckily, network analysis offers a method of analysis that tackles complex data and offers a way of revealing trends.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>A network is basically a collection of nodes (dots) and edges (lines that connect dots). Nodes can represent anything, such as agents (people), 
					institutions (e.g., universities), and objects. The edges represent instances where two nodes share a relationship of some kind.
					We can assign attributes to the nodes and edges in a network. For example if a node represents a person, it may have information regarding gender,
					ethnicity, or other demographic information. Edge attributes represent the characteristics of the relationship shared between nodes. An important 
					edge attribute is the weight of the edge. This is a value that is used to represent the strength of a relationship between two nodes, and may be derived in 
					a multitude of ways (such as frequency, distance, correlations, amongst others).

					<p>The image presented above provides an example of a network that uses student data. In this network, nodes represent courses offered by the University of 
					Auckland. Edges represent instances where a student took a pair of courses within their first year at the university. Instead of having a single edge 
					for each student who took a pair of courses, we can aggregate these edges and use that frequency as a weight for a single edge. In our case, we have 
					used a different metric called Revealed Comparitive Preference (RCP) to highlight the pairs of courses that are most interesting. This 
					type of weight brings a pair of courses closer together if there more students taking that pair of courses relative to the overall population of the network, and the number of 
				   in each course. </p>
					
					<br>
					<p>Once this network has been formed, we can run community detection to reveal the clusters of courses that tended to be taken together. In our case, 
					we used Louvain community detection, which is an algorithm that groups nodes together by maximising the modularity score of the network. 
					This is a fancy way of saying that nodes that have lots of connections are grouped together, while nodes in different communities have sparcer connections
					Each community seems to represent a different degree structurs at the University of Auckland, which is not surprising. For example, we would expect Bachelor of Arts students
					to take similar courses to one another, and different from Bachelor of Science students. Red seems to represent the arts, Yellow the science, purple the 
					engineering, and orange the music. </p>
					
					<p>Now we can look at subsets of the main network in more detail. In the following case, I have just taken the students who studied at least one 
					physics course at the University of Auckland.</p>
					<center>
					<IMG src="PhysNetwork1.png" alt="physicsStudentNetwork" style="width: 100%;">
					</center>
					<br>
					<p><li>We can compare male and female students by aggregating edges within and between communities based on the gender of the student. 
					The following network presents a cleaner version of the network by summarising each community into a single node that is labeled according to the 
					courses that are present within the community. Edges in the network are show an odds ratio: the likelihood of a female student taking a pair of courses 
					within a community (self-loops) or between two communities. The size of the nodes now represent aggregated course populations for each community. </li></p>

					<IMG src="PhysNetworkCom.png" alt="physicsStudentNetworkCommunities" style="width: 100%;">
					</center>
								
					<p>As we can see, female students were around 3.4 times more likely to take a pair of courses within the life sciences and psychology community. 
					Male students were more likely to take courses within the physics, maths, computer science community and between that community and engineering.</li></p>

					<h1> The Leaky Pipeline</h1>
					<p>Now the trends identified in our quick and dirty network analysis, although interesting, are very common for post-compulsory education 
					in New Zealand and across the world. Historically, these patterns have been explained in terms of the "Leaky Pipeline". This model basically 
					presents the idea that science education is like a big long pipe that stretches from primary school all the way through high school, and 
					finally ends with graduation from university and entering into the workforce. However, with each transition from one educational stage
					to the next, students "leak" out of the pipeline and disappear forever. The gender disparities outlined in our networks would therefore 
					be explained in terms of female students being more likely to leak from physics, maths, engineering etc., and male students being more likely 
					to leak from the life sciences. Now as soon as you start labelling students as "leaks", this analogy needs to be fixed. Students can take a wide range 
					of pathways through high school and university study. Instead of one big pipe, we need to start thinking in terms of a complex collection of pipes, each 
					one pretty much unique to individual students. Students don't leak, they make study decisions based on the realities in which they are based. Simply 
					labelling students as leaks or dropouts stigmatizes the individual and neglects the socio-cultural context in which students are placed. With the 
					increasing abundance of student data, and with the help of techniques such as network analysis, we have no excuse for ignoring context.
					</p>

					<center><h1> If we want to understand and address gender and classed disparities in science 
					education, we need to move beyond the leaky pipeline model of student attrition and onto research frameworks

				<h1> Pierre Bourdieu</h1>

					<p><i>Pierre Bourdieu realising he left the oven on at home - photograph by Leonardo Antoniadis </i></p>
					<p>The sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu offers one such avenue for framing the journeys that students 
					take through higher education. Bourdieu was a french sociologist who was active from around 1960 to 1990, with his work (in partiular
					his seminal book "Distinction") leaving a lasting influence on educational research. One major advantage offered by Bourdieu's framework is 
					the manner by which it encourages a mixed method approach to research. In fact, for Bourdieu, a true social science is one that combines the objective, 
					and quantitative, with the subjective and qualitative. His original work included ethnographic research, photograph case studies, interviews, 
					and large scale surveys. With so many different research paradigms, it is difficult to understand how they can fit together to provide a 
					cohesive narritive about how society operates. Bourdieu's theoretical framework provides a means to tackle this issue. His theory not only allows
					us to interpret both quantitative and qualitive results, but it also provides a method of understanding how the objective and subjective are 
					linked (he dubbed this mode of inquiry Genetic Structuralism).</p>
					
					<p>In the simplest terms, Bourdieu was interested in the way that power is distributed in society, and how this relates to an individual's
					practices (behaviours and attitudes) within society. The theoretical framework that he conceptualised is vast, and since this aim of this piece is to 
					offer a quick introduction to his work, I will be focussing on a simplified theoretical model that Bourdieu outlined in Distinction. </p>

					<p>Bourdieu saw an individual's practices (behaviours and attitudes) in society as being generated by the interaction between capital and habitus.

					<p><h1>Capital</h1></p>
					<p>Capital is a resource that one can use to gain advantage in society. For Bourdieu, it can take one of four forms: economic, cultural, social 
					or symbolic. For this piece, I will focus on economic and culutal capital, as it is these two forms of capital that are the most relevant in the 
					research I will discuss late. For a fuller explanation of capital, The Forms of Capital by Bourdieu is the best place to start.</li></p>

						<IMG src="CulturalCapital.png" alt="CulturalCapital" style="width: 100%;">
					</center>
					<p>Bourdieu is probably most famous for his concept of cultural capital. It refers to an individual's non-financial assets. This can refers
					to the objects we engage with, such as the textbooks, computers, and media (tv shows). It is easy to understand how this form of 
					objectified cultural capital can be advantageous for students. If you grow up reading science textbooks or magazines, you will likely do
					better with science at school. But 
					<p><li>The way we embody culture (language, posture, thought processes - habitus)</li></p>
					<p><li>Certificates from institutions (course grades, diplomas, degrees)</li></p>

					<h2>How Capital Relates to Equity</h2>
					<p>The key thing for Bourdieu is that inequity is driven by the fact that capital is not distributed evenly across society. By this I mean that 
					some individuals can be born with a high level of resources at their disposal, whilst others can be born into poverty. It may be clear how this 
					relates to economic capital. Being born into wealth is one of the best predictors of educational success. But Bourdieu especially emphasized the 
					advantages gain by being born into a family that shares the dominant culture in society. These individual's learn from the very begining the 'correct'
					way of behaving, speaking, and interacting with those in charge. The concept of cultural capital is more tacit than econmic capital, but one example that
					has a clear and lasting impact is language. Individuals who are born into families who have a good grasp of the dominant language (i.e., the one used by 
					schools) have a clear advantage when it comes to schooling. They are more likely to enter education with the literacy skills required to function 
					in the classroom. Kids born into families that either do not speak the dominant language or do not have a lifetime of experience with it will start on the 
					back foot.
					<br>
					Capital is also accumulative. This means that the more capital you have, you are more able to invest it in ways that return more capital. 
					A good example of this can be seen in education. If your family has lots of money, you can afford to go to university. 
					With a university degree you are more able to get a high paying job, and therefore get more money.</p>
